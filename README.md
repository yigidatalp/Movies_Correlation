# Movies_Correlation
In this project, I used the data from movies dataset in Kaggle and analyzed what variables affect the gross revenue. 
Then, I created a correlation matrix heatmap and regression plot by using Matplotlib and Seaborn. 
Also, I processed data by converting all non-numeric variables into numeric ones and then normalized this converted data.
